#Load packages, view data
```{r}
#load dslabs and tidyverse packages
library("dslabs")
library("tidyverse") 
library("broom")

#look at gapminder help file
help(gapminder)
#get data structure overview
str(gapminder)
#get data summary
summary(gapminder)
#determine gapminder object type
class(gapminder)
```

#Create new objects as subset of original dataset
```{r}
#Assign African countries to new object
africadata <- gapminder %>% filter(continent=="Africa")
#get data structure overview for africadata
str(africadata)
#get data summary
summary(africadata)

#make new variable containing infant_mortality and life_expectancy
mort_life <- africadata %>% select(infant_mortality, life_expectancy)

#make new variable containing population and life_expectancy
pop_life <- africadata %>% select(population, life_expectancy)

#view data structure for new variables
str(mort_life)
str(pop_life)

#view data summaries for new variables
summary(mort_life)
summary(pop_life)
```

#Create plots of selected data
```{r}
#plot life expectancy vs infant mortality
ggplot(mort_life, aes(infant_mortality, life_expectancy)) + geom_point()
#In this plot we see a negative correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy
#There were also 226 missing values exluded from this plot

#plot life expectancy vs population (log scale)
ggplot(pop_life, aes(population, life_expectancy)) + geom_point() +scale_x_log10()

```
In this plot, we see a positive correlation between population and life expectancy, in "streaks". Looking at the original dataset, africadata, shows that a wide span of yeares (1960 to 2016) is probably the source of the feature in the plot. Another note: there were 51 observations with missing values for this plot. 

#Data cleaning
```{r}
#Let's select one year with a large amount of data to eliminate the limitations we saw above. 

#Figure out which years have missing infant mortality data


africadata[!complete.cases(africadata$infant_mortality),] #this line of code will show us the opposite of complete cases (meaning missing or NA cases) for the infant_mortality variable within our dataset
#we can see that infant_mortality is missing from 1960 to 1981, and for the year 2016

#We'll look at the year 2000 instead

#extract observations for year 2000 only
africadata_2000 <- africadata %>% filter(year==2000)

#check data structure for new object
str(africadata_2000)

#check summary of data for new object
summary(africadata_2000)
```

#Recreate plots
```{r}
#recreate above plots for year 2000 only
#plot life expectancy vs infant mortality
ggplot(africadata_2000, aes(infant_mortality, life_expectancy)) + geom_point()
#we see a negative correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy in this plot

#plot life expectancy vs population (log scale)
ggplot(africadata_2000, aes(population, life_expectancy)) + geom_point() +scale_x_log10()
#we don't see any obvious relationship between population and life expectancy in this plot
```

#Apply statistics to data
```{r}
#use a linear model to fit the data with infanct mortality as the predictor
fit1 <- lm(life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africadata_2000)

#use a linear model with population size as the predictor
fit2 <- lm(life_expectancy ~ population, data = africadata_2000)

#view summary of fit1 and fit2
summary(fit1)
summary(fit2)
```

Conclusion:
The p-value for the linear model using infant mortality as the predictor is < 0.05, while the p-value for the linear model using population as the predictor is > 0.05. This suggests that infant mortality correlates significantly with life expectancy and is a better predictor of life expectancy than is population size. 

#Subset data
```{r}
#Create subset of africadata with  infant mortality and fertility
v1<- africadata %>% select("infant_mortality", "fertility")

#Create subset of africadata with GPD and population
v2<- africadata %>% select("gdp", "fertility")
```

#Visualization
```{r}
#Plot of infant mortality vs fertility
ggplot(africadata, aes(infant_mortality, fertility)) + geom_point()
#We noticed a positive correlation between infant mortality and fertility

#Plot of infant GPD vs. population
ggplot(africadata, aes(gdp, fertility)) + geom_point()
#We noticed negative correlation between fertility and GPD
```
#Fit a lineal model 
```{r}
#Analyzed how infant mortality and GDP perform as predictor of fertility

#Fertility Vs Infant mortality
fit3<- lm(fertility ~ infant_mortality, data = africadata)

#Fertility Vs. GDP
fit4<- lm(fertility ~ gdp, data= africadata)

#View the summary of fit3 and fit4
summary(fit3)
summary(fit4)
```
#According with the summaries, both fit3 and fit4 have p-values <0.05. Then, infant mortality and GDP could be good predictors of fertility.

#Using broom package will convert the output from lm function into a table.(Library("broom") is at the begging of the code ;)

#Tabular outputs with "broom"
```{r}
#View Fertility Vs Infant mortality
tidy(fit3)

#View Fertility Vs. GDP
tidy(fit4)
```

#The outcomes are showing that there is relatinship between Fertility and Infant mortality as well as relationship between Fertility and GDP. In both cases the p-values were <0.05, indicanding that infant mortality and GDP may have a predictie relationship with fertility.
